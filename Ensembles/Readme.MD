# Ensemble Models

Ensemble models were developed in [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ "Weka 3: Data Mining Software in Java") software. Cost sensitive classifiers were identified and stacked by level-0 algorithm (CART).

Several models were computed to differenciate between training and tuning process and predictive models.

Models are depicted in the Knowledge Flow regime.
